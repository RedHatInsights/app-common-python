=================

Simple client access library for the config for the Clowder operator.

Usage
-----

To access configuration, see the following example

```
from app-common-python import LoadedConfig

func main() {
    if LoadedConfig.isClowderEnabled() {
        fmt.Printf("Public Port: %s", LoadedConfig.PublicPort)
    }
}
```

The ``clowder`` library also comes with several other helpers

* ``LoadedConfig.rds_ca()`` - creates a temporary file with the RDSCa and 
  returns the filename.
* ``KafkaTopics`` - returns a map of KafkaTopics using the requestedName
  as the key and the topic object as the value.
* ``KafkaServers`` - returns a list of Kafka Broker URLs.
* ``ObjectBuckets`` - returns a list of ObjectBuckets using the requestedName
  as the key and the bucket object as the value.
* ``DependencyEndpoints`` - returns a nested map using \[appName\]\[deploymentName\] 
  for the public services of requested applications. 
* ``PrivateDependencyEndpoints`` - returns a nested map using \[appName\]\[deploymentName\] 
  for the private services of requested applications.
* ``Database`` - returns an object that provides a URI string for connection to a database
  also provides a ``log()`` method for obscuring the user/pass and a ``admin()`` method for
  providing a URI with the admin credentials.
